# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The objective of this project is to create a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict bank account fraud. To accomplish this, we will train and evaluate the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms: Logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and XGBoost.

The results of this research are summarized in the paper 'Machine Learning Algorithms in Bank Account Fraud Detection'
